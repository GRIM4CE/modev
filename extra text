<p>The Capital One DevExchange Hackathon is an invitation and referral only event designed to allow teams of Developers, UI and UX Designers to leverage recently published APIs by Capital One to enhance existing apps or to build entirely new applications and services. This event is a part of and precedes the DevExchange Summit, which takes place Dec 1-2 in Mclean, VA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This event is unique in the sector with an invitation and referral only approach. By taking place on a weekday, this event will be a day of fun and professional development for those who are participating vs. a hobby or simply an attempt at recognition for rapid prototyping. Participants are seeking to bolster an existing app or jumpstart a desire to join one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy.</p>
