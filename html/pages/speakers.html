              <p>Cybercriminal business models drive the global malware epidemic now at 500M+ new variants per year. Malware monetization methods have shifted in favor of short-term revenue opportunities. Reactive threat detection capabilities are incapable of facing these threats. In this talk we discuss a novel approach to proactive threat detection, developed using bioinformatics techniques with help of deep learning neural networks.</p>

              <p>It is well known among industry practitioners that security breaches cost companies over $500 billion last year; less well known is the statistic that 95% of those breaches were due to human error. While most employees are not actively seeking to cause their companies harm, few are aware of the significant costs their basic mistakes often create for their organizations. This talk will explore the many problems facing companies and CISOs due to simple human error, recent, high viz examples, and potential solutions.</p>

              <p>Your supply chain has been compromised. Now what? Just as in the recent case of Juniper’s back door in the source code, you wonder ‘How did it get there?’ Even after discovering the root of the problem, the question is still ‘What other ways could it get there?’ And ‘What can be done to help secure the supply chain going forward?’ Join Adrian Guevara, VP of Security, as he presents both hypothetical and actual breach data from Juniper and other publicly known breaches and covers the following to leave attendees with data that can be applied to the everyday life of a developer.</p>

              <p>Continuous Security is the implementation of security best practices and validation through the execution of automated, repeatable code and configuration orchestrated by the Continuous Delivery pipeline. By utilizing automation to implement and test security policies, we simplify the process of demonstrating controls and compliance, documenting policy and allowing for repeatability.</p>
              <p>In this talk we cover the stages of a typical Continuous Delivery pipeline and the security and compliance validation that can be inject in each for rapid security feedback and enforcement of security standards.</p>

              <p>In the cloud era, startups and entrepreneurs start building their MVP products in the cloud. As many of us focus on getting things up and running first, we don't pay much attention to how to secure our cloud based assets. The session will be given real use cases on how to secure products using Microsoft intelligent cloud in Azure. The session covers different cloud based assets such as: storage, databases, microservices, application layers and services based layers.</p>
