          <h4 class="talk-speaker">with Cheryl Blanchard, MicroChips Biotech</h4>
          <div class="read-more-text closed">
            <p>When we think about healthcare, we more often than not think of illnesses and diseases and what it takes to cure them or, at the very least, manage chronic issues. Despite the explosion of technology in virtually every other market sector, from banking and finance to telecommunications, healthcare has been generally slow to upgrade and adapt to more digital means of care management. But just what is “digital health?” In this presentation/discussion, Cheryl Blanchard, Ph.D., President and CEO of Microchips Biotech, Inc., discusses digital health in medicine, where it is heading, and just how it can help bring the healthcare field into the 21st century of total disease management.</p>

            <p>Other discussion topic: It’s not Healthcare 24/7/365, it’s Compliance 24/7/365 - Rising healthcare costs continue to be a problem in America. But a large chunk of those costs come from individuals not being compliant with their medications, costing the industry loads of money to the tune of almost $300 billion a year. With the FDA’s 2016 approval for an implant to dispense opioid addiction medication, one has to wonder: Will this help to launch implantable drug delivery devices into mainstream healthcare? In this presentation/discussion, Cheryl Blanchard, Ph.D., President and CEO of Microchips Biotech, Inc., discusses the push towards implantable, wearable devices to deliver drug doses from a remote location, the costs saved and associated with such a push for technology, and what happens when you remove the “human error” component from the equation and subsequently the problem of compliance.</p>
