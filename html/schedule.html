          <div class="read-more-text closed">
            <p>Home healthcare solutions for chronic care patients are on the rise, as are the number of connected, digital devices intended to make home healthcare smarter, more effective, and more efficient. The promise of the new breed of home medical and fitness devices (wearables) is well-covered, but what of the growing pantheon of non-medical “lifestyle” devices? Specifically, what opportunities do the new voice interaction devices like the Amazon Echo and Google Home provide for increasing patient engagement, improving quality of care and outcomes, and reducing risks for individuals with healthcare needs at home?</p>
            <p>In this session, we’ll demonstrate a voice-powered “digital healthcare agent” built for the Amazon Echo and other voice platforms. We’ll also look at a specific application of this digital agent, currently in development with a regional home care provider, for engaging and supporting chronic care patients in complex populations.</p>

          <h4 class="talk-speaker">with Raychel Muenke, Kindara</h4>
          <div class="read-more-text closed">
            <p>From a young age, women hear messages about avoiding pregnancy. The options are not always great-the pill can have side effects, condoms can reduce sensation, etc. When a woman decides it is time to become a mother, there is pressure to get pregnant immediately. At Kindara, we employ scientifically backed methodology to help women understand their cycle to either become pregnant quickly or utilize Fertility Awareness Based methods to avoid pregnancy naturally. Our Bluetooth connected BBT thermometer, Wink, makes charting quick and easy. In this talk, you will learn about why women's fertility is vital to a well-functioning society and how connected devices can help fill the need to make understanding this process more enjoyable and simple.</p>

          <h4 class="talk-speaker">with Cheryl Blanchard, MicroChips Biotech</h4>
          <div class="read-more-text closed">
            <p> When we think about healthcare, we more often than not think of illnesses and diseases and what it takes to cure them or, at the very least, manage chronic issues. Despite the explosion of technology in virtually every other market sector, from banking and finance to telecommunications, healthcare has been generally slow to upgrade and adapt to more digital means of care management. But just what is “digital health?” In this presentation/discussion, Cheryl Blanchard, Ph.D., President and CEO of Microchips Biotech, Inc., discusses digital health in medicine, where it is heading, and just how it can help bring the healthcare field into the 21st century of total disease management.</p>
            <p> Other discussion topic: It’s not Healthcare 24/7/365, it’s Compliance 24/7/365 - Rising healthcare costs continue to be a problem in America. But a large chunk of those costs come from individuals not being compliant with their medications, costing the industry loads of money to the tune of almost $300 billion a year. With the FDA’s 2016 approval for an implant to dispense opioid addiction medication, one has to wonder: Will this help to launch implantable drug delivery devices into mainstream healthcare? In this presentation/discussion, Cheryl Blanchard, Ph.D., President and CEO of Microchips Biotech, Inc., discusses the push towards implantable, wearable devices to deliver drug doses from a remote location, the costs saved and associated with such a push for technology, and what happens when you remove the “human error” component from the equation and subsequently the problem of compliance.</p>
