We'll go over strategies for managers, lead developers, and mentors on how to cultivate your new hire and grow a culture that ensures everyone on the team thrives.

            <p class="read-more-text">This short talk is aimed at technology professionals who understand that the tech industry has a diversity problem but don't know what they can personally do to make things better. The talk will not attempt to convince anyone that there is a lack of diversity in tech, that this lack is not due to a lack of talent among diverse candidates, or that the tech industry will be stronger when its diversity increases. It will instead present five specific actions that we can all take in our everyday lives to make the technology industry more welcoming to underrepresented minorities. It will also provide links to resources that allies may find helpful.</p>
